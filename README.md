# OSLOPROMPT: Bridging Low-Supervision Challenges and Open-Set Domain Generalization in CLIP (CVPR 2025)

Official repository of OSLOPROMPT, one of the first works in Low-shot Open Domain Generalization using pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16106) to focus on the completely unlablled real-world open samples in low-shot scenarios.

## Abstract
We introduce Low-Shot Open-Set Domain Generalization (LSOSDG), a novel paradigm unifying low-shot learning with open-set domain generalization (ODG). While prompt-based methods using models like CLIP have advanced DG, they falter in low-data regimes (e.g., 1-shot) and lack precision in detecting open-set samples with fine-grained semantics related to training classes. 
To address these challenges, we propose OSLoPrompt, an advanced prompt-learning framework for CLIP with two core innovations. First, to manage limited supervision across source domains and improve DG, we introduce a domain-agnostic prompt-learning mechanism that integrates adaptable domain-specific cues and visually guided semantic attributes through a novel cross-attention module, besides being supported by learnable domain- and class-generic visual prompts to enhance cross-modal adaptability.  Second, to improve outlier rejection during inference, we classify unfamiliar samples as unknown and train specialized prompts with systematically synthesized pseudo-open samples that maintain fine-grained relationships to known classes, generated through a targeted query strategy with off-the-shelf foundation models. This strategy enhances feature learning, enabling our model to detect open samples with varied granularity more effectively. 
Extensive evaluations across five benchmarks demonstrate that OSLoPrompt establishes a new state-of-the-art in LSOSDG, significantly outperforming existing methods

## How to install

Please follow the [ODG-CLIP](https://github.com/mainaksingha01/ODG-CLIP) Repo for installation.

To the run model for a specific dataset
 
 ```
$ python pacs.py \
        --source_domains "$source_str" \
        --target_domain "$target" \
        --shots $shots \
        --config $config \
        --output_dir "./experiments_mini" \
        --data_root "$data_root"
```
where source_str is source domains (as a single string seperated by commas) given in the sorted order and $target represents the target.  

- Change the source domains and target domain orders accordingly . For examples, source_domains = 'art_painting,cartoon,photo', target= 'sketch'.
- Results will be saved in output_dir provided.
- Training models of each epoch will also be saved in `output_dir` folder.
